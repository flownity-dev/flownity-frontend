# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the data management functionality for fetching project data and creating new projects in the Flownity application. The implementation will integrate with the existing projectService.ts API layer and existing UI components to provide data fetching and creation logic. No new UI components will be created as they already exist.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement project data fetching logic, so that existing UI components can display real project data instead of sample data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the projects component mounts THEN the system SHALL fetch all projects using the getAllProjects API
2. WHEN projects are successfully fetched THEN the system SHALL update the component state with the real data
3. WHEN projects are loading THEN the system SHALL set appropriate loading state
4. IF the API call fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error and set error state
5. WHEN the component unmounts THEN the system SHALL clean up any pending requests

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement project creation logic, so that users can create new projects through existing form components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project creation form is submitted THEN the system SHALL call the createProject API with the form data
2. WHEN project creation is successful THEN the system SHALL update the projects list with the new project
3. WHEN project creation is successful THEN the system SHALL reset the form state
4. IF project creation fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error appropriately
5. WHEN creating a project THEN the system SHALL validate the form data before API call

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper state management for projects, so that the application maintains consistent data state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN projects data changes THEN the system SHALL update all relevant component states
2. WHEN multiple components need project data THEN the system SHALL provide a consistent data source
3. WHEN API operations complete THEN the system SHALL synchronize the local state with server state
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain previous valid state until resolved
5. WHEN components re-render THEN the system SHALL prevent unnecessary API calls

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace sample data with real API integration, so that the application works with actual backend data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing data fetching THEN the system SHALL remove any hardcoded sample project data
2. WHEN integrating APIs THEN the system SHALL use the existing projectService functions
3. WHEN handling responses THEN the system SHALL work with the actual API response structure
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle real API error responses
