# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a dedicated Projects Component that provides a comprehensive view of all projects in the system. The component will be accessible through the existing "Projects" navigation item in the sidebar and will replace the current placeholder HomePage component for the `/projects` route. The interface will include filtering capabilities, a project table, and action buttons for project management, following the current Material-UI theme and design system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to view all projects in a dedicated projects page, so that I can have a centralized overview of all project information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on the "Projects" navigation item in the sidebar THEN the system SHALL navigate to the `/projects` route and display the Projects Component
2. WHEN the Projects Component loads THEN the system SHALL display a page header with the title "Projects"
3. WHEN the Projects Component is rendered THEN the system SHALL use the current Material-UI theme colors and styling
4. WHEN the Projects Component is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design principles for mobile and desktop views

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter projects by status, so that I can focus on active or archived projects as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Projects Component loads THEN the system SHALL display filter buttons for "All" and "Archived" project statuses
2. WHEN a user clicks the "All" filter button THEN the system SHALL log the filter action to the console and highlight the active filter
3. WHEN a user clicks the "Archived" filter button THEN the system SHALL log the filter action to the console and highlight the active filter
4. WHEN the Projects Component initializes THEN the system SHALL set "All" as the default active filter

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to create new projects, so that I can add projects to the system for tracking and management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Projects Component loads THEN the system SHALL display a "New" button in the top-right area of the interface
2. WHEN a user clicks the "New" button THEN the system SHALL log the create action to the console
3. WHEN the "New" button is displayed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate styling to make it visually prominent
4. WHEN the "New" button is rendered THEN the system SHALL follow Material-UI button design patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see projects displayed in a table format, so that I can easily scan and compare project information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Projects Component loads THEN the system SHALL display a project table with columns for Project Name, Start Date, End Date, and Project Status
2. WHEN the project table is rendered THEN the system SHALL use Material-UI Table components for consistent styling
3. WHEN the project table area is displayed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate spacing and layout within the overall component structure
4. WHEN the project table is shown THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling with the rest of the application
5. WHEN the project table displays data THEN the system SHALL format dates appropriately and show status information clearly
6. WHEN the project table is displayed THEN the system SHALL include pagination controls in the top-right area of the table
7. WHEN a user interacts with pagination controls THEN the system SHALL log the pagination action to the console

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Projects Component to integrate seamlessly with the existing application architecture, so that it maintains consistency and follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Projects Component is created THEN the system SHALL place it in the appropriate components directory structure
2. WHEN the Projects Component is implemented THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript for type safety
3. WHEN the Projects Component is built THEN the system SHALL follow the existing code organization patterns used in other components
4. WHEN the Projects Component is integrated THEN the system SHALL update the routing configuration to use the new component instead of HomePage for the `/projects` route
