# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a Task Group detail view that allows users to view and manage individual tasks within a specific task group. The view will display task group information at the top and provide a comprehensive table showing all tasks with their details including name, deadline date, assignee, and approver. This follows the same pattern as the existing Project detail view but focuses on task-level management within a task group context.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to view a detailed page for a specific task group, so that I can see the task group information and manage all tasks within that group.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to a task group detail page THEN the system SHALL display the task group name and description at the top of the page
2. WHEN the task group detail page loads THEN the system SHALL show a "New" button for creating new tasks
3. WHEN the task group detail page loads THEN the system SHALL display a tasks table below the header information
4. IF the task group does not exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN the page is loading THEN the system SHALL show a loading state indicator

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to see all tasks in a task group displayed in a table format, so that I can quickly review task details and status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tasks table is displayed THEN the system SHALL show columns for Name, Deadline Date, Assignee, and Approver
2. WHEN there are no tasks in the task group THEN the system SHALL display an empty state message
3. WHEN the table fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an error state with retry option
4. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display tasks in a card format instead of a table
5. WHEN viewing on tablet devices THEN the system SHALL use a responsive table layout
6. WHEN there are multiple tasks THEN the system SHALL implement pagination to display a limited number of tasks per page
7. WHEN pagination is active THEN the system SHALL show page navigation controls below the tasks table

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to create new tasks within a task group, so that I can add work items to the group.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "New" button THEN the system SHALL log a console message (placeholder functionality)
2. WHEN the "New" button is clicked THEN the system SHALL NOT open any modal or perform actual task creation
3. WHEN the "New" button is displayed THEN it SHALL be positioned in the top-right area of the task group header

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate through multiple pages of tasks, so that I can efficiently browse large numbers of tasks within a task group.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are more tasks than can fit on one page THEN the system SHALL display pagination controls using the existing pagination component pattern
2. WHEN a user clicks on a page number THEN the system SHALL navigate to that page and display the corresponding tasks
3. WHEN pagination is displayed THEN it SHALL show the current page, total pages, and navigation controls following the same design as Projects and TaskGroups pagination
4. WHEN the user changes pages THEN the system SHALL load the tasks for the selected page
5. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the pagination SHALL use the same mobile-friendly layout as existing pagination components

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the task group detail view to be responsive, so that I can use it effectively on different device sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display task information in card format
2. WHEN viewing on tablet devices THEN the system SHALL use a responsive table layout
3. WHEN viewing on desktop devices THEN the system SHALL display the full table with all columns
