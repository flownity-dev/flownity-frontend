4. WHEN the modal is open THEN the system SHALL maintain the current MUI theme styling and colors

5. WHEN the user interacts with form fields THEN the system SHALL follow Material-UI form styling conventions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to save or cancel my project creation, so that I can either create the project or abandon the process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modal is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a "Create Project" button with primary color styling
2. WHEN the modal is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a "Discard" button with secondary/neutral color styling

4. WHEN the user clicks the "Discard" button THEN the system SHALL close the modal without saving any data
5. WHEN the user clicks either button THEN the system SHALL reset the form fields for the next use

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the modal to be responsive and accessible, so that I can use it effectively on different devices and with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modal is displayed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adjust the modal size and layout appropriately
2. WHEN the modal opens THEN the system SHALL focus on the first input field
3. WHEN the modal is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent spacing and typography with the existing design system
