# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a detailed project view component that allows users to view comprehensive information about a specific project. The component will display project details, provide tabbed navigation between Task Groups and Members, and include a collapsible right sidebar for additional project information. This view will be accessible through React Router and integrate with the existing navigation structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to view detailed information about a specific project, so that I can understand the project scope and current status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to a project detail URL THEN the system SHALL display the project name and description
2. WHEN the project detail view loads THEN the system SHALL show the project information in the main content area
3. IF the project data is not available THEN the system SHALL display placeholder content
4. WHEN the view is rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing left navigation structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between different project information views, so that I can access task groups and member information separately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project detail view loads THEN the system SHALL display tabs for "Task Groups" and "Members"
2. WHEN a user clicks on a tab THEN the system SHALL switch the active tab and update the content area
3. WHEN the "Task Groups" tab is active THEN the system SHALL highlight it as the selected tab
4. WHEN the "Members" tab is active THEN the system SHALL highlight it as the selected tab
5. WHEN either tab is selected THEN the system SHALL display placeholder content for future implementation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want access to a collapsible right sidebar, so that I can view additional project information when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project detail view loads THEN the system SHALL display a collapsible right sidebar
2. WHEN the sidebar is expanded THEN the system SHALL show an empty content area for future project information
3. WHEN the sidebar is collapsed THEN the system SHALL hide the sidebar content and expand the main content area
4. WHEN a user interacts with the sidebar toggle THEN the system SHALL smoothly animate the sidebar transition

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate to specific projects through URL routing, so that I can bookmark and share direct links to project details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/project/:id` THEN the system SHALL display the project detail view
2. WHEN the route includes a project ID parameter THEN the system SHALL use it to identify the specific project
3. WHEN the project detail view is active THEN the system SHALL maintain the URL structure for bookmarking
4. WHEN a user navigates back THEN the system SHALL return to the previous view using React Router

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the project detail view to integrate seamlessly with the existing application design, so that the user experience remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project detail view renders THEN the system SHALL use Material-UI components consistent with the existing design
2. WHEN the view is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design principles
3. WHEN the component loads THEN the system SHALL follow the established TypeScript patterns
4. WHEN styling is applied THEN the system SHALL use the existing theme and styling approach
