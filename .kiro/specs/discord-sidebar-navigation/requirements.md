# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the current top navigation bar into a Discord-style sidebar navigation that provides a more modern and space-efficient navigation experience. The sidebar will be collapsible, maintaining a minimal icon-only view when collapsed and expanding to show full navigation labels when expanded. The navigation will be fixed to the full height of the page and include the three main sections: Dashboard, Projects, and Task Groups, along with theme toggle and user profile functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a collapsible sidebar navigation so that I can maximize my workspace while maintaining quick access to navigation options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the sidebar SHALL be displayed in expanded state by default
2. WHEN the user clicks the collapse toggle THEN the sidebar SHALL animate to a collapsed state showing only icons
3. WHEN the sidebar is collapsed THEN it SHALL maintain a minimum width to display navigation icons clearly
4. WHEN the user clicks the expand toggle THEN the sidebar SHALL animate back to expanded state showing icons and labels
5. WHEN the sidebar state changes THEN the main content area SHALL adjust its layout accordingly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sidebar to be fixed to the full height of the page so that navigation remains accessible even when scrolling through content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the sidebar SHALL be positioned fixed to the left side of the viewport
2. WHEN the user scrolls the main content THEN the sidebar SHALL remain in its fixed position
3. WHEN the viewport height changes THEN the sidebar SHALL automatically adjust to fill the full height
4. WHEN the main content is scrollable THEN the sidebar SHALL not interfere with the scrolling behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate between Dashboard, Projects, and Task Groups sections so that I can access different areas of the application efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar is displayed THEN it SHALL show navigation items for Dashboard, Projects, and Task Groups
2. WHEN the user clicks on a navigation item THEN the application SHALL navigate to the corresponding route
3. WHEN a navigation item is active THEN it SHALL be visually highlighted to indicate the current page
4. WHEN the sidebar is collapsed THEN navigation items SHALL display appropriate icons only
5. WHEN the sidebar is expanded THEN navigation items SHALL display both icons and text labels

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme toggle and user profile access to remain available in the sidebar so that I can maintain the same functionality as the current navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar is displayed THEN it SHALL include a theme toggle control at the bottom
2. WHEN the user clicks the theme toggle THEN it SHALL switch between light and dark modes
3. WHEN the sidebar is displayed THEN it SHALL include user profile access at the bottom
4. WHEN the user clicks the profile area THEN it SHALL display the user menu with profile options
5. WHEN the sidebar is collapsed THEN theme toggle and profile SHALL display as icons only

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sidebar to have smooth animations and transitions so that the interface feels polished and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar expands or collapses THEN it SHALL animate smoothly over a reasonable duration
2. WHEN navigation items are hovered THEN they SHALL provide visual feedback with smooth transitions
3. WHEN the main content adjusts to sidebar changes THEN it SHALL transition smoothly without jarring layout shifts
4. WHEN icons and text appear or disappear THEN they SHALL fade in/out smoothly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sidebar to be responsive and work well on different screen sizes so that I can use the application on various devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the viewport is on mobile size THEN the sidebar SHALL automatically collapse to save space
2. WHEN the viewport is on tablet size THEN the sidebar SHALL maintain its collapsible functionality
3. WHEN the viewport is on desktop size THEN the sidebar SHALL support both expanded and collapsed states
4. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the sidebar SHALL adapt its behavior appropriately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript types and interfaces defined for the sidebar component so that the code is maintainable and type-safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sidebar components are created THEN they SHALL have proper TypeScript interfaces defined
2. WHEN navigation items are defined THEN they SHALL use a common type interface
3. WHEN sidebar state is managed THEN it SHALL use properly typed state variables
4. WHEN common types are needed across components THEN they SHALL be defined in a common.types file
