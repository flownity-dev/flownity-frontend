# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements API service helper functions using axios for handling authentication routes in the Flownity Frontend application. The service will provide clean, reusable functions for interacting with the backend authentication endpoints, including OAuth flows for GitHub and Google, logout functionality, and token refresh capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized authentication service module, so that I can easily make API calls to authentication endpoints without duplicating axios configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the authentication service is imported THEN it SHALL provide a configured axios instance with the base URL localhost:3000/auth
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the service SHALL handle HTTP requests and responses consistently
3. WHEN an API call fails THEN the service SHALL propagate errors appropriately for handling by calling components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to initiate OAuth authentication with GitHub, so that I can log into the application using my GitHub account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating GitHub OAuth THEN the service SHALL redirect to the GitHub authentication endpoint
2. WHEN the GitHub callback is processed THEN the service SHALL handle the callback response appropriately
3. WHEN GitHub authentication succeeds THEN the service SHALL return authentication tokens or user data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to initiate OAuth authentication with Google, so that I can log into the application using my Google account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating Google OAuth THEN the service SHALL redirect to the Google authentication endpoint
2. WHEN the Google callback is processed THEN the service SHALL handle the callback response appropriately
3. WHEN Google authentication succeeds THEN the service SHALL return authentication tokens or user data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log out of the application, so that my session is terminated and my account is secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logout is requested THEN the service SHALL make a POST request to the logout endpoint
2. WHEN logout succeeds THEN the service SHALL return a success response
3. WHEN logout fails THEN the service SHALL return an appropriate error response

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to refresh authentication tokens, so that users can maintain their session without re-authenticating.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token refresh is requested THEN the service SHALL make a POST request to the refresh endpoint
2. WHEN refresh succeeds THEN the service SHALL return new authentication tokens
3. WHEN refresh fails THEN the service SHALL return an error indicating the need for re-authentication

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean and simple service functions, so that the authentication API integration is maintainable and easy to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing service functions THEN they SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
2. WHEN implementing service functions THEN they SHALL have minimal complexity and focus only on API communication
3. WHEN implementing service functions THEN they SHALL not include unnecessary features or abstractions
4. WHEN implementing service functions THEN they SHALL use TypeScript for type safety
