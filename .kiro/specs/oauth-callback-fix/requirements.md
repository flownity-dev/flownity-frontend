# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current OAuth authentication flow for both GitHub and Google has several issues preventing successful user authentication and redirection. The login buttons open the OAuth providers in new tabs for both GitHub and Google, but the callback handling is not working properly, preventing token storage and dashboard redirection. This feature will fix the OAuth callback flow for both providers to ensure proper authentication, token storage, and user redirection.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to successfully authenticate with GitHub or Google OAuth so that I can access the protected dashboard and other application features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Continue with GitHub" button THEN the system SHALL initiate the GitHub OAuth flow in the same window
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Continue with Google" button THEN the system SHALL initiate the Google OAuth flow in the same window
3. WHEN the GitHub OAuth provider redirects back to the application THEN the system SHALL properly handle the callback with the authorization code
4. WHEN the Google OAuth provider redirects back to the application THEN the system SHALL properly handle the callback with the authorization code
5. WHEN the callback is processed successfully THEN the system SHALL store the authentication token in localStorage
6. WHEN the token is stored THEN the system SHALL store the user information in localStorage
7. WHEN authentication is complete THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the OAuth flow to work seamlessly without opening new tabs so that I have a smooth authentication experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates GitHub OAuth authentication THEN the system SHALL use the same window instead of opening a new tab
2. WHEN a user initiates Google OAuth authentication THEN the system SHALL use the same window instead of opening a new tab
3. WHEN the OAuth flow completes for either provider THEN the system SHALL maintain the application state and context
4. WHEN there are OAuth errors from either provider THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user
5. WHEN the callback URL contains error parameters THEN the system SHALL handle and display the error appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling during the OAuth flow so that I understand what went wrong if authentication fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the OAuth callback contains an error parameter THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN the backend API call fails during callback processing THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
3. WHEN network errors occur during authentication THEN the system SHALL provide retry options
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL clear any partial authentication state
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate information for debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the OAuth callback to properly extract and use the authorization code for both GitHub and Google so that the backend can exchange it for an access token.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the OAuth callback URL is processed THEN the system SHALL extract the authorization code from URL parameters
2. WHEN the authorization code is extracted THEN the system SHALL send it to the appropriate backend callback endpoint (GitHub or Google)
3. WHEN the backend returns a successful response THEN the system SHALL extract the token and user data
4. WHEN the callback processing is complete THEN the system SHALL clean up the URL parameters
5. WHEN the callback URL contains a state parameter THEN the system SHALL validate it for security
6. WHEN the callback URL contains a provider parameter THEN the system SHALL route to the correct provider handler
